since i can't get cygwin to work, then alternate solution.
this is to use multiple programs to simulate what a bash shell would do.

not a fan of mingw-w64

git for windows is a minimal functional environment but not very useful

----------------------------------------

gnuwin32 provides some minimal utilities to use.
download, install, copy folder, then add the C:\Software_Installs\Dev\gnuwin32\bin folder to PATH environment variable.

got a zsh.exe file form a link there
but putting zssh in bin folder doesnt work, zsh cant call the other exes...

install mingw32 to C:\MinGW, then move it to Dev and change PATH
