Notes on maintaining Windows XP
========================================

Specifically: Windows XP Home with Service Pack 3

I started maintaining this computer in July 2018.
It seems like the last time this computer was actively used was mid 2014.
When I got the computer it looked like it was reset at some point because all of the old applications are gone.
There were some new applications that have been installed, and the time clock was reset to invalid value in 1988
there is most likely a disorganized structure on the C: drive.
this computer is old and most likely suffering form windows rot.
if possible it would be good to go through the control panel to uninstall, auto clean,
then going through the C: drive and its subfolders and manually cleaning out residue
the idea is to form a normalized base version of xp

steps:
  - catalog existing installed programs
  - catalog locations of programs on disk
  - remove programs with control panel
  - cycle through disk clean up leftover folders and files
  - run chkdsk, defrag, etc...
  - make a new folder on the C: drive specifically for installs
  - reinstall software (update if possible)  
  - run any updates

manually clean the registry keys with regedit
uninstallers are in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
  
Now any time when installing new software:
If Microsoft stuff, service packs, updates, tools, etc... let it install normally where ever on C: drive
Else install it specifically to the software install folder "C:\Software Installs"
catalog each install also, then it makes it easy to track what is happening
then preferably the important stuff is segregated from the other stuff

eventually merge both the old and new installs lists

========================================

Old & Still installed (check control panel)

certain software programs will be uninstalled when replacement installers are found,
then they will be migrated to the install folder

ERRORS: 

(Hoyle, Atari, Office 97: specifically since these are from previous windows versions)

Hoyle Classic Casino can't play sound

Atari Arcade Hits 1 can't play sound

Microsoft Office 97
- Microsoft Office 97 Setup was not completed successfully
  Htmlmarq.ocx was unable to register itself in the system registry
- Microsoft Access can't find the Visual Basic for Applications dynamic-link library (DLL) Vba332
  Rerun the Microsoft Access Setup program
- when try to run Microsoft Office Setup gets a setup initialization error
- Can't uninstall through control panel, gets setup initialization error because Off97Pro.STF is missing or corrupted
solution:
manually delete everything, then remove the registry keys

Python
the python 2.7 and python 3.4 executable are both default named to "python" so there is name conflict with executables. always python3 called.
had to change name of executable to "python3.exe" and then make new shortcuts to the python and idle
by doing this it breaks the old shortcuts, and the uninstall feature in control panel.
to fix needs to run the installer again and repair the install first before doing something.
now can call both executables and it will find the correct version
python  -> python 2.7.15
python3 -> python 3.4.4
