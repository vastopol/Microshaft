Git for Windows

As of Git for Windows v2.10.1, Windows Vista or later are required. 
The last version of Git for Windows to support Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 is v2.10.0.

Parts of Git are implemented in shell script, and Git for Windows runs those scripts via MSYS2's POSIX emulation layer,
which in turn is based on the Cygwin POSIX emulation layer. Seeing as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are years past their official end of life,
the Cygwin project ended their Herculean efforts to support those Windows versions.

python on windows

not sure which versions will run on xp for python2.7 

As specified in PEP 11, a Python release only supports a Windows platform while Microsoft considers the platform under extended support. 
This means that Python 3.7 supports Windows Vista and newer. If you require Windows XP support then please install Python 3.4.
after version 3.4.4 then only becomes source code and must be compiled 
the last windows XP Python build is 3.4.4 : https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-344/ 3.4.7 (2017-08-09) is available as code source
According To The Python Official Website, Python 3.5+ cannot be used on Windows XP or earlier.

Try Using The Latest Supported Version 

While CPython 3.5 doesn't work on XP, there is PyPy, an alternative Python implementation that does work.
However, current version PyPy3.5 v6.0 doesn't yet support asyncio module, probably the most interesting part of 3.5 update.

python 2.7.15
python 3.4.4

ironpython 2.7.8 would not install

masm 11 sdk

http://www.masm32.com/

This version is for NT based systems from WIN2000 upwards. 
The oldest recommended Windows version is XP SP3 as many of the binaries in the MASM32 SDK require RGB/A support. 
The SDK will run on Win2000 but some of the graphics will not display properly.

NOTE on the version of MASM supplied in the MASM32 SDK.
The versions supplied will write code that works correctly on Windows operating systems
from Win95 OEM up to the current versions of Windows. As the Microsoft binaries date from the middle Win98 era,
they do not support the later SSE, AVX and AVX2 instruction sets. For the advanced programmer already experienced in using MASM,
it is advisable to obtain the appropriate SDK or Visual C/Studio version from Microsoft for the operating system version they are using
so that they can use the later instruction sets in advanced code.
