POWERSHELL

- basics:
  * a few of the most basic commands work like linux -> ls, cd, mv, ...
  * still set shell variables same  -> $variable = value

- microsoft "equivalent" ideas for linux:
  * less -> use either "more" or "Out-Host -Paging"

- version info:
  * Get-Host 
  * $PSVersionTable

- command line parameters: 
    special variable $args
    $args is array of all command line arguments
    some methods for args -> $args.length, $args.count, etc...

- param statement:
    param([type]$p1 = , [type]$p2 = , ...)

- To create a blank file: 
  * New-Item -ItemType file example.txt
  * echo $null > $file
  * Add-Content $file $null

- string concatenate: use "-join"
    $str1 = "aa"
    $str2 = "bb"
    $str3 = -join($str1,$str2)

- to source the location of a file:
    uses "." as an operator to include in the scope

- to run another script from in a script:
    uses "&" or ".\" or "Invoke-Expression"
